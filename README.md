# Mesh Perlin Noise

This program renders a rotatable mesh using OpenGL and GLUT. The mesh is terrain generated by the perlin noise. The mesh is often very round and looks like hills because it does not use octaves.

Confirmed to work on Mac OSX. On linux please change the Makefile to link the OpenGL and GLUT libraries.
